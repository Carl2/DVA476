#+TITLE: CNN Image Classification Project








* Overview

This project is a deep learning application for classifying satellite
images from the /EuroSAT/ dataset using Convolution Neural Network. It
is built using Python and the PyTorch framework. The software is
sepperated into data handling, network architecture, and the main
training/inference logic into distinct modules.

The core of the project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
designed for image classification. The entire workflow is controlled
by a central JSON configuration file, making it flexible and easy to
adapt for different experiments. The system supports two primary modes
of operation:

  + *Training:* Trains the CNN model from scratch on the EuroSAT
    training dataset, validates it, and saves the best-performing
    model.
  + *Inference:* Loads a pre-trained model and evaluates its
    performance on a test dataset, producing detailed metrics and
    visualizations.


A key feature is its ability to automatically calculate and cache
normalization statistics (mean and standard deviation) for the
dataset, which is a crucial step for model performance.






* Project Structure & Components

The codebase is modular, promoting a clean separation of concerns:

+ *=cnn_model.py=*: This is the main entry point of the
  application. It handles command-line argument parsing, loads the
  configuration file, and orchestrates the entire training or
  inference pipeline by calling functions from other modules.

+ *=nn/network.py=*: Contains the core deep learning logic.
  * *=CNN= class*: Defines the neural network architecture. It's a
    standard CNN with two convolutional blocks (Conv2D, BatchNorm,
    ReLU, MaxPool, Dropout) followed by two fully connected layers.

  * *Training & Validation*: Includes functions like
    =train_one_epoch=, =validate_one_epoch=, and the main
    =training_loop=. It handles the mechanics of feeding data to the
    model, calculating loss, backpropagation, and updating weights.

  * *Inference*: The =inference_loop= function is dedicated to
    evaluating a trained model.

  * *Model I/O*: =save_model= and =load_model= functions for saving
    and loading model checkpoints.

+ *=nn/dataset.py=*: Manages data loading.
  * *=EuroSatDataset= class*: A custom PyTorch =Dataset= that
    efficiently loads EuroSAT images and their corresponding labels
    from disk.

  * *=create_data_loader=*: A factory function that wraps the
    =EuroSatDataset= in a PyTorch =DataLoader=, which handles
    batching, shuffling, and multi-threaded data loading.

+ *=common/utils/=*: A directory of shared utility modules.
  * *=load_data.py=*: Contains helper functions to parse the
    configuration file, identify image paths for different dataset
    splits (train/validation/test), and generate appropriate data
    augmentation and normalization transforms
    (=torchvision.transforms=).

  * *=stats.py=*: A powerful utility that can calculate the mean and
    standard deviation of the entire training dataset. The
    =ensure_normalization_stats= function cleverly checks if these
    values are in the config file; if not, it calculates them and
    saves them back to the json-file for future runs.

  * *=plotter.py=*: Responsible for generating visualizations of the
    results, including confusion matrices and plots of training
    history (accuracy/loss vs. epochs).

  * *=config_helper.py=*: A module with various helper functions to
    safely read values from the nested configuration dictionary.

* Current Status

The project has a solid foundation with well-defined components for
configuration, data loading, and model architecture. However, it is a
work in progress, and could be done cleaner, but time is of an essence.


** Implemented:
   - Configuration management.
   - Data loading pipeline for identifying file paths.
   - Complete CNN model definition.



* How to Run

Currently, the program can be run to load the configuration and
prepare data paths, but it will not perform any training.

Make sure to edit the configuration file with the proper paths to the
  - path :: where to find the /EuroSAT/ image files.

 if unsure of the /mean/ and /std/, remove them and the calculation
 will be done and added to the configuration.

   - train classes :: each class is represented in the name and has a
     - start :: which index to of the file
     - end :: where to end

  for example "train":
#+begin_src json
  .....
  "train" {
      "AnnualCrop": {
          "start": 1,
          "end": 2100
      }......
  }
#+end_src

will start read the range of image file /AnnualCrop_1.jpg/ →
/AnnualCrop_2100.jpg/ for training, and similarly for test and
validation.



To run the script:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
python cnn_model.py --config config.json
#+END_SRC

This will train the model, the saved model is *model_settings*
*save_path*. Together with hyperparameters that can be changed to
find a better opimization.

The metrics are saved in *logging* as a /csv/ file.
If not cleaned the new values will be appended, this gives the graph.
reversed lines going back, but at the same time you can compare
different, training sessions.

| Argument       | Required | Description                                               |
|----------------+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| =--config=     | *Yes*    | The path to your =config.json= file.                      |
| =--test-model= | *No*     | The path to a pre-trained model file (=.pt=).             |
|                |          | If this is provided, the script runs in *inference mode*. |

** Training

#+begin_src bash
python cnn_model.py --config config.json
#+end_src

** Testing
#+begin_src bash
python cnn_model.py --config config.json --test-model models/best_model.pt
#+end_src



* Expected outcome and outputs.

** During training
If /mean/ and /std/ is not set in the configuration, it will be
calculated before training starts, and will be written to the
/config.json/ for caching.

+ *Console Output:* You will see progress bars for each
 epoch, followed by a summary of the training and validation loss
 and accuracy for that epoch.

+ *Saved Model:* The best model (based on validation accuracy) will be
  saved to the path specified by =save_path= in your config (e.g.,
  =models/best_eurosat_model.pt=).


+ *Metrics Log:* A CSV file will be created at the path specified by
  =metrics_csv= (e.g., =logs/training_metrics.csv=). It will contain
  the =epoch=, =train_loss=, =train_acc=, =val_loss=, and =val_acc=.

+ *History Plot:* After training completes, a plot named
  =training_history.png= will be generated and displayed, showing the
  accuracy and loss curves over epochs.


* During Inference

1.  *Console Output:* You will see a progress bar for the evaluation, followed by a final report containing:
    *   Total test samples.
    *   Final Loss and Accuracy on the test set.
    *   A *Confusion Matrix* printed directly to the console.
2.  *Plot Files:* Several plots will be generated and saved as image files:
    *   =confusion_matrix.png=: A heatmap visualization of the confusion matrix with raw counts.
    *   =per_class_metrics.png=: Bar charts showing Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for each of the 10 classes.
